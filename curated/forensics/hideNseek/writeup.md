# FORENSICS
# HIDE N SEEK
## CHALLENGE
we are given a image and urged to use stegseek
## FLAG
`nite{h1d3_4nd_s33k_but_w1th_st3g_sdfu9s8}`
## MY SOLVE
1. we were already asked to use stegseek.
2. so i just installed stegseek. ran it with rockyou wordlist
3. it returned an .out file
4. by catting that file i find flag as `nite{h1d3_4nd_s33k_but_w1th_st3g_sdfu9s8}`
## LEARNING
1. i prev used to use steghide but it requires password and is not suitable for bruteforcing
2. stegseek is lightnining fast at bruteforcing and getting the hidden text
